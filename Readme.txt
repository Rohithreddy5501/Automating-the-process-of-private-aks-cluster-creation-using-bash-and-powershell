The script can be used from devops pipelines as well as azure cli.
You can standard error on aks create command as private dns zones need network links for dns resolution, so once you add network links and run aks update command to make this available.
I have used sharepoint form and azure logic apps to automate the process in devops.
So you will just submmit form and everything will be automated.
